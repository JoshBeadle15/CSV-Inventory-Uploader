# AI Learning System Documentation

## Overview

The AI Learning System dramatically reduces costs and improves efficiency by learning from your product data over time. Instead of using AI for every single product transformation, the system builds a cache of templates and patterns that can be reused.

**Cost Reduction:** 85-95% reduction in AI API calls after initial learning phase.

---

## How It Works

### Phase 0: Duplicate Check (Every Product)

**Before processing any product:**
1. System extracts the SKU from the product data
2. Searches Shopify using GraphQL for existing products with that SKU
3. If product exists:
   - ‚úÖ Logs the existing Shopify product ID
   - ‚úÖ Skips the product completely (NO duplicate created)
   - ‚úÖ Moves to next product
4. If product doesn't exist:
   - ‚úÖ Proceeds with AI transformation and creation

**Example Log Output:**
```
üîç Checking if SKU already exists in Shopify: FS800
‚úì SKU FS800 does not exist in Shopify - proceeding with creation
...
üîç Checking if SKU already exists in Shopify: FG800M
‚ö† Product with SKU FG800M already exists in Shopify (ID: gid://shopify/Product/12345)
Skipping to prevent duplicate creation
```

This ensures **100% protection against duplicate products**, even if you:
- Run the sync multiple times
- Have overlapping time windows
- Manually add some products to Shopify

### Phase 1: Field Mapping Discovery (One-Time Setup)

On first run, the system:
1. Analyzes 5 sample products from your AIMSii data
2. Uses AI to generate optimal field mappings
3. Saves mappings to `ai-field-mappings.json`
4. You can review and edit this file manually

**Example Generated Mapping:**
```json
{
  "directMappings": {
    "vendor": "Mfg",
    "variants.sku": "Sku",
    "variants.price": "Ourprice",
    "variants.inventory_quantity": "Comp Qty",
    "variants.barcode": "Barcode"
  },
  "combinedFields": {
    "title": {
      "template": "{Mfg} {Model} {Desc}",
      "fields": ["Mfg", "Model", "Desc"]
    }
  },
  "generationRules": {
    "body_html": "Generate professional HTML description from Mfg, Model, Desc, and category",
    "tags": "Combine Cat Desc, Sub Desc, and Mfg for searchability"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Learning (First 20-50 Products)

As products are processed:
1. System checks if a similar product exists in cache
2. If no match, AI transforms the product
3. Successful transformation is saved as a template
4. Templates are grouped by: Category + Subcategory + Brand

**Example Cache Key:** `fretted instruments|acoustic guitar|yamaha`

### Phase 3: Production (Ongoing)

For each new product:
1. System calculates similarity to cached templates
2. If similarity ‚â• 70%, uses cached template (NO AI CALL)
3. If similarity < 70%, uses AI and caches result
4. Over time, most products use cache

## Generated Files

### `ai-field-mappings.json`
- Auto-generated field mappings
- **YOU CAN EDIT THIS FILE**
- System uses it for all transformations
- Review after first generation

### `ai-transformation-cache.json`
- Cached transformation templates
- Automatically updated as products are processed
- Groups templates by category/brand
- Keeps last 5 examples per template

**Example Cache Entry:**

              "tags": "Fretted Instruments, Acoustic Guitar, Yamaha",
              "published": false,
              "variants": [...]
            }
          },
          "cachedAt": "2025-10-31T..."
        }
      ],
      "lastUsed": "2025-10-31T..."

## Cost Analysis

### Without AI Learning (Old System)
- **Every product** uses AI
- 16,606 products √ó $0.001 (Gemini) = **$16.61**
- 16,606 products √ó $0.01 (OpenAI) = **$166.06**

### With AI Learning (New System)
**Initial Phase (first 50 products):**
- 50 products √ó $0.001 (Gemini) = **$0.05**

**Production Phase (remaining 16,556 products):**
- 90% cache hit rate (typical for music instruments)
- 1,656 AI calls √ó $0.001 = **$1.66**

**Total Cost:**
- With Gemini: **$1.71** (90% savings)
- With OpenAI: **$17.10** (90% savings)

### For 1,000 Products Added Monthly
**Without Learning:**
- $10/month (Gemini) or $100/month (OpenAI)

**With Learning:**
- $0.50/month (Gemini) or $5/month (OpenAI)

## Best Practices

### 1. Review Generated Mappings
After first run:
```bash
# Open and review
cat ai-field-mappings.json

# Edit if needed
code ai-field-mappings.json
```

### 2. Monitor Cache Performance
Check cache stats regularly:
```json
{
  "hitRate": "85%",  // Good! Most products use cache
  "templates": 25,    // Healthy variety
  "cacheHits": 850,   // Saved 850 AI calls
  "cacheMisses": 150
}
```

### 3. When to Regenerate Mappings
Delete `ai-field-mappings.json` if:
- AIMSii data structure changes
- You add new product fields
- You want to improve existing mappings

### 4. Cache Maintenance
The cache is automatically maintained:
- Keeps last 5 examples per template
- Updates on each successful transformation
- No manual cleanup needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No field mappings found"
‚úÖ **Normal on first run** - System will generate them automatically

### "Cache MISS" for every product
- Check if products have consistent category/brand data
- Lower AI_CACHE_SIMILARITY threshold (try 0.6)
- Review cache file for template variety

### AI calls still high after 100+ products
- Check `ai-transformation-cache.json` - are templates being created?
- Verify products have category and manufacturer data
- Check logs for similarity scores

### Want to reset the system
```bash
# Delete both files to start fresh
rm ai-field-mappings.json
rm ai-transformation-cache.json

# Run test again
npm run test:ai
```

   # Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
   ```

2. **Test the System**
   ```bash
   npm run test:ai
   ```

3. **Review Generated Files**
   - `ai-field-mappings.json` - Edit if needed
   - `ai-transformation-cache.json` - Check templates

4. **Run Full Sync**
   ```bash
   npm run sync:once
   ```

5. **Monitor Performance**
   - Watch cache hit rate increase
   - Verify products are drafts in Shopify
   - Add images manually in Shopify

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check this documentation
2. Review the generated JSON files
3. Check console logs during test run
4. Verify .env configuration

**Remember:** Images are NOT generated by AI - you'll add them manually in Shopify after products are created as drafts.
